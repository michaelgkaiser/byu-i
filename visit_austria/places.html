                <p>Majestic mountains, tranquil lakes, rolling hills of orchards, or bustling cities with hundred-year-old 
                    buildings, filled with modern life - where would you like to start out on your Austria adventure?
                    With hundreds of museums, galleries, and exhibitions, there is so much to explore. The nine provinces 
                    of Austria each offer their own charm, unique accent and traditional garb. You may pass through in a day
                    or stay a life-time and still discovery something new each day.

            <p class="plc-paragraph">Austria is a federation of nine provinces, and with appoximately 85,000 square kilometers and under 9 million
                inhabitants there is plenty of space for everyone. 
                In the west of the country you will find high mountain peaks and low valleys with few big cities and many 
                small villages nestled in tranquil and remote spots, perfect for an escape from the hussle and bussle of 
                modern life. The olympic city of Innsbruck in the heart of Tyrol is a wintersport paradise. There also is 
                hardly a better spot for hiking and mountain-biking in the summer. 
                The central region and south boast more lakes and is very popular for summer enthusiasts who prefer a spot 
                on the water while baking in the sun. As Austria is surrounded by other countries you are never too far away
                from the border. After a day at the lake, why not take a short roadtrip to Italy for some dinner with authentic
                italian pizza and some gelato for dessert? The southern province Carinthia has also been a border region for 
                several centuries and is littered with castles and fortresses that allow the visitor to dream of a time long gone,
                when knights on horseback defended these regions.
                Northern Austria is home to industry with many highly sought-after schools for austrian and international students.
                In spite of industry there is an abundance of farmland and gives those interested in the backbone of a country's 
                production the chance to take a deeper look and get hands on experience on how things are made.
                Go to the east of Austria and you will fall in love with rolling hills, with fruit orchards and wine country. Many 
                specialties are made here from freshly pressed apple cider and pumpkinseed oil, to delicious treats like the 'Sachertorte', 
                a chocolate cake that will have you coming back for more, or the 'Krapfen', a cousin to the donut, filled with apricot jam
                and dusted with powdered sugar. Right in the middle of this breathtaking garden lies the city of Vienna, a melting pot full of life
                and history. Vienna, as the former home of the royal family, offers numerous palaces and chateaux, many museums worth
                visiting, and is a place where one can absorb true austrian modern culture and lifestyle.
