            <p class="ppl-paragraph">The Austrian-Hungarian Empire dominated Europe for half a century and became the home of many who
                shaped history, the world of science, music and the arts. This dominating monarchy ended with the 
                outbreak of the first World War. The Austrian is by nature resilient and driven, and despite the 
                ravages of two world wars and economic crisis, Austrians rebuilt their beloved home and held on to 
                the traditions that would carry them through the years and give them a sense of pride and patriotic love 
                for the place they call 'Oesterreich' - the kingdom in the East.

                    <h2 class="people-heading">Austrians up close</h2>
                    <p>Austrians are fond of their spare time and in the south-eastern provinces of Styria and Carinthia it 
                        is very popular to visit a 'Buschenschank' in the evening, a farm-to-table eating experience. 
                        Soccer is the most popular sport in the country, and even the smallest village boasts its own 
                        soccer field. As fans are fiercly loyal, games are well attended, and the excitement can be heard for miles.
                        Snow-skiing comes in as a close second and since the country lies at the eastern edge of the Alps there 
                        is no shortage of snow in the mountains, and fathers and mothers take great pride in shepherding their 
                        offspring down the slopes.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="people-heading">Live like an Austrian</h2>
                    <p>With its mountains, lakes, forests and fields, Austria invites you to get outside and find your 
                        favorite spot to relax and let nature wash over you. Maybe it is this ample supply of fresh air that
                        gives Austrians a very high life expectancy, for both men and women. 
                        Traditions are passed down through the families, from the old the the next generation, and so it is 
                        well worth to catch a religious or cultural festival and buy a souvenir at an old-fashioned farmer's 
                        market. 
                    </p>    
                    <h2 class="people-heading">Experience the warm welcome</h2>
                    <p>There is no perfect season to visit Austria. You can expect to be received with warm hearts and open
                        arms, and you will want to come back. If you take the time you will find that the Germanic roots with
                        the often harsh-sounding German language seemingly gives these mountain people a hard shell, but
                        Austrians are like the wonderful bread they bake - a crusty outside, warm and comforting on the 
                        inside.
