            <p class="hero-paragraph">The country and its people whisper of a time almost forgotten through its 
                culture and values that echo through the ages. The grandeur of the monarchy with its riches and 
                influence faded, the people and the beauty stayed and became a hidden jewel to be discovered and 
                treasured. Be prepared to leave a part of your heart behind, but to leave richer for it.
                Spend a day in a picturesque 
                alpine village, located in the Eastern Alps, in the province of Tyrol, or visit the birthplace 
                of Mozart, in the romantic city of Salzburg, go on a river tour along the Danube through the 
                heart of Austria's capital Vienna, and stop at Hochosterwitz Castle, an unconquered fortress in 
                the province of Carinthia. Throughout history many warring peoples occupied this central European 
                region, they all left their mark, but the Austrian heart remained true to its roots - warm and 
                welcoming, with rich customs that fill holidays, festivals and the homes of the young and the 
                elderly. Are you ready to visit Austria and to allow some of its heritage to rub off on you?

            <p class="about_people">The German-Austrian actor Christoph Waltz said:"The beauty of Austria lies not only
                in its landscapes but also in its people, who radiate warmth, hospitality, and a love 
                for their heritage." In a world, where change seems to be the only constant, lies 
                Austria, with deep roots and an open invitation to you.

            <p class="about_places">So much is packed into Austria. The history of Austria is bloody, hence the flag of the 
                Austrian Republic was born in battle as Duke Leopold V, drenched in blood, removed his
                belt and saw that the linen underneath was still white. Find out why this area in the 
                heart of Europe is so coveted.
