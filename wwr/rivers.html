            <h1>The Rivers</h1>
                <img class="adventure-img1" src="images/rafting_idaho.jpg" alt="Main Fork of Salmon River">
                <h2 class="idaho-river">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p class="idaho">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The 
                    Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living 
                    near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the 
                    rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
                    sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring 
                    ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
                    from sun or rain when needed.
                    
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the 
                    longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is 
                    higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the 
                    late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like 
                    to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                <h2 class="utah-river">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p class="utah">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                    the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone 
                    cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 
                    84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
                    and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
                    and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                    
                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based 
                    on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <img class="adventure-img3" src="images/rafting_arizona.jpg" alt="Grand Canyon in Arizona">
                <h2 class="arizona-river">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p class="arizona">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will 
                    never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to 
                    make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with 
                    exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible 
                    only by river.
                    
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon 
                    are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and 
                    river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating 
                    scale, so we often refer to both.

                <img src="images/tiff.jpg" alt="girl avatar">
                <p>"Tiff" was born with an oar in her hand. As a junior kayaking national champion she doesn't 
                    need an excuse to get into the water. She loves adventure and gets in the boat with noobies
                    or hardened experts. If you have kids in your group she is very experienced in making sure 
                    the little ones feel safe and have a great time. With more than 12 years of rafting and 
                    kayaking experience, she will take you through the roughest patches and leave you wanting to 
                    go again.

                <h3>Rufio Gonzales, 42</h3>
                <img src="images/rufio.jpg" alt="guy avatar">
                <p>Rufio has traveled far and wide to experience the rush of a white water tumble. He would be the 
                    first to say that rafting is his life. He grew up in Colorado and knows the rivers of the mountain
                    west better than his own backyard. With over 10,000 hours of rafting adventures there is nothing 
                    he hasn't seen yet, and he will stay cool even in the wildest water rodeo.

                <img src="images/taylor.jpg" alt="girl avatar">
                <p>Her friends call her "Tiny" but don't be fooled by her nickname. She might not be tall in stature, 
                    but she is a powerhouse when it comes to white water rafting. Taken rafting by her father since she 
                    was a very young girl, she has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to staying safe on the waves and 
                    navigating through the wildest patches. She is also an expert on outdoor survival and you cannot spend 
                    any amount of time with her without learning something new. She is our newest team member and has 
                    rafted all over the globe. Finally settling down in northern Utah, she is living her dream of
                    combining her passion for teaching with the white water.
