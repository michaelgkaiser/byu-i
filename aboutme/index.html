    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h3>Nickname: MH</h3>
    <p>Hello friends! Here are a few things about me. I was born and raised 
        in the very south of Austria, but I currently live in Salt Lake City, UT. 
        I served a mission in the England Manchester Mission, and after returning
        home I met my wife, Mindy, after moving to Innsbruck, Austria to go to school.
        We moved to Utah close to where Mindy grew up and started our family. We 
        have four children, the oldest of which just started at BYU-I on campus in 
        Rexburg, ID, and we are now racing to see who will finish first with a Bachelor's
        degree.
    </p>
    <p>About a year ago I started to once again pursue my dream of finishing school.
        I loved the PathwayConnect program and I have been so impressed with the 
        instructors and classes I take through the Pathway program. I work in the 
        printing industry, and part-time at a hotel. I do enjoy working hard, but 
        I truly love the outdoors and doing something and anything active.
    </p>
    <p>By going back to school I am working towards a career change. Something inside 
        of me constantly pushes me to learn something new. Anything to do with computers
        seemed to be so complicated to me, but the more I learn about programming the 
        more it interests me. 
    </p>
    <p>Although I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints 
        all my life, my faith and testimony constantly evolve, and like with programming - 
        the more I learn about our Heavenly Father and His plan for His children, the more 
        I want to know Him and about Him. I am grateful for every opportunity that is given 
        to me to learn more and deepen my understanding.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck to all of you!</p>
