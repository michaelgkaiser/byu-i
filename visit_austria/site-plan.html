        and begs the visitor to explore its people and places, that have something to offer for anyone who
        loves adventure, a good view, and plans to make some memories. Plan to spend a day in a picturesque 
        alpine village, located in the Eastern Alps, in the province of Tyrol, or visit the birthplace of 
        Mozart, in the romantic city of Salzburg, or go on a river tour along the Danube through the heart. 
        of Austria's capital Vienna, and stop at Hochosterwitz Castle, an unconquered fortress in the province.
        of Carinthia. Throughout history many warring peoples occupied this central European region, they all
        left their mark, but the Austrian heart remained the same - warm and welcoming, with a rich customs
        that fill holidays, festivals and the homes of the young and the elderly. Visiting this gem
        and allowing some of its heritage rub off on you is an experience that will change your life.

      <h3>The People</h3>
      <p> 
        The Austrian-Hungarian Empire dominated Europe for half a century and became the home of many who
        shaped history, the world of science, music and the arts. This dominating monarchy ended with the 
        outbreak of the first World War. The Austrian is by nature resilient and driven, and despite the 
        ravages of two world wars and economic crisis, Austrians rebuilt their beloved home and held on to 
        the traditions that carry them through the years and give them a sense of pride and patriotic love 
        for the place they call 'Oesterreich' - the kingdom in the East. 
        Austrians are fond of their spare time and in the south-eastern provinces of Styria and Carinthia it 
        is very popular to visit a 'Buschenschank' in the evening, a farm to table eating experience. 
        Soccer is the most popular sport in the country, and even the smallest village will boast its own 
        soccer field. As fiercely loyal fans games are well attended, and the excitement can be heard for miles.
        Snow-skiing comes in as a close second and as the country lies at the eastern edge of the Alps there 
        is no shortage of snow in the mountains and fathers and mothers take great pride in shepherding their 
        offspring down the slopes.
        With its mountains, lakes, forests and fields, Austria invites everyone to get outside and find your 
        favorite spot to relax and let nature wash over you. Maybe it is this ample supply of fresh air that
        gives Austrians a very high life expectancy, for both men and women. 
        Traditions are passed down through the families, from the old the the next generation, and so it is 
        well worth to catch a religious or cultural festival and buy a souvenir at an old-fashioned farmer's 
        market. 
        There is no perfect season to visit Austria. You can expect to be received with warm hearts and open
        arms, and you will want to come back. If you take the time you will find that the Germanic roots with
        the often harsh-sounding German language seemingly gives these mountain people a hard shell, but
        Austrians are like the wonderful bread they bake - a crusty outside, but warm and comforting on the 
        inside.

      <h3>The Places</h3>
      <p>
        Austria is a federation of nine provinces, with appoximately 85,000 square kilometers and under 9 million
        inhabitants there is plenty of space for everyone. 
        In the west of the country you will find high mountain peaks and low valleys with few big cities and many 
        small villages nestled in tranquil and remote spots, perfect for an escape from the hussle and bussle of 
        modern life. The olympic city of Innsbruck in the heart of Tyrol is a wintersport paradise. There also is 
        hardly a better spot for hiking and mountain-biking in the summer. 
        The central region and south boast more lakes and is very popular for summer enthusiasts who prefer a spot 
        on the water while baking in the sun. As Austria is surrounded by other countries you are never too far away
        from the border. After a day at the lake, why not take a short roadtrip to Italy for some dinner with authentic
        italian pizza and some gelato for dessert. The southern province Carinthia has also been a border region for 
        several centuries and is littered with castles and fortresses that allow the visitor to dream of a time long gone,
        when knights on horseback defended these regions.
        Northern Austria is home to industry with many highly sought-after schools for austrian and international students.
        In spite of industry there is an abundance of farmland and gives those interested in the backbone of a country's 
        production the chance to take a deeper look and get hands on experience on how things are made.
        Go to the east of Austria and you will fall in love with rolling hills, with fruit orchards and wine country. Many 
        specialties are made here from freshly pressed apple cider and pumpkinseed oil, to delicious treats like the 'Sachertorte', 
        a chocolate cake that will have you coming back for more, or the 'Krapfen', a cousin to the donut, filled with apricot jam
        and dusted with powdered sugar. Right in the middle of this breathtaking garden lies the city of Vienna, a city full of life
        and history. Vienna, as the former home of the royal family, offers numerous palaces and chateaux, many museums worth
        visiting, and is a place where one can absorb true austrian modern culture and lifestyle.
